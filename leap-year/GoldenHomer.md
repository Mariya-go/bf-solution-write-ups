```js
function isLeapYear(year) {
  return (year % 100 !== 0 && year % 4 === 0) || year % 400 === 0;
}
```

## Strategy

<!--
  GoldenHomer trying to check if the year is / by 4 and if the year is not / by 100 or is the year / by 4 and year / by 400.

-->

## Implementation

<!--
  He use the % operator to check if year / 4 = 0 and he use && to check if year not / by 100.
  He use === to check a condition
-->

## Possible Refactors

<!--
  We can use another if else conditions.
